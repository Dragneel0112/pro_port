Avoid south-facing positions, especially if the soil is very dry. Organic, slow-release fertilizers (such as a 15-10-10, or 10-5-5 formula) work well on hydrangeas, giving the plants the nutrients, they need to increase the size and quantity of their blooms','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Hydrangea.jpeg','f1246833-e566-466c-af56-af007e794e44'),('24817cd6-dbfe-43fd-ac25-ebc02ae78018','2023-06-26 02:29:18','2023-06-26 02:29:18','Cabbage','Like most vegetables, cabbage needs at least 6 hours of full sun each day; more is better. It also needs fertile, well-drained, moist soil with plenty of rich organic matter. The soil pH should be between 6.5 and 6.8 for optimum growth and to discourage disease. A diluted solution of a balanced (10-10-10) liquid fertilizer, weak compost tea, or fish emulsion is recommended. This can be repeated every two weeks.

Wait until the vegetable garden is dry enough to work then dig deeply and amend the planting area with a good amount of compost or other organic matter. Parsnips need a loose, aerated soil to grow into well-shaped roots. They do not need extra watering, except in really dry conditions, a good watering every two-three week should be fine. Calcium should be 60%-85% base saturation. Less nitrogen fertilizer will be needed as high amounts of nitrogen to parsnips can cause excessive top growth, increasing their susceptibility to diseases','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Parsnips.jpeg','1943c1c2-3bb6-42d0-a813-b995058b94c6'),('2faa83f6-ac97-4e1d-b8de-806099d65e6a','2023-06-26 02:26:15','2023-06-26 02:26:15','Turnip','Turnips are cool season vegetables that prefer sunny locations and fertile, deep, well-drained soils.

The ideal soil pH is between 6.5 and 7.5. Potting soil works just fine, but compost, peat moss and even vermiculite can be added. It is important to keep the soil moist at all times, and you may have to water the plants daily. If soil was well prepared no extra fertiliser should be necessary.','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Watercress.jpeg','3be966b2-0d15-488f-a888-af687cb98125'),('45fd1960-a903-40d8-9729-92b928242f1d','2023-06-26 02:17:06','2023-06-26 02:17:06','Beetroot','Optimum temperatures for beetroot growth and development are 15°C to 18°C. Although beetroot is a cool-season crop, it is fairly tolerant to high temperatures, provided that soil moisture is adequate.  Beetroot can be grown on a wide range of soils, but best results are obtained on well-drained sandy to loamy soils, with optimum pH 6 to 8. Fertilizer recommendation is a ratio of 2:3:4 for beetroots.','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Beetroot.jpg','1943c1c2-3bb6-42d0-a813-b995058b94c6'),('4b2525e8-e596-467b-acd5-6a3e86b23404','2023-06-26 02:22:11','2023-06-26 02:22:11','Potato','Potatoes can be grown in a variety of soils, but the best results come from solid with a good soil structure, lots of organic matter, good drainage and depth. A soil pH of between 5.2 and 6.4 is most suitable for potato farming. When planting, an NPK ratio of 15-15-15 is ideal. A month or two after they have been planted, potatoes need lots of nitrogen, so a fertilizer with an NPK of 34-0-0 is the best choice. An NPK of 12-12-17 or 14-7-21 is best for the last couple of months before harvest when the plants require more potassium.','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Potato.jpeg','1943c1c2-3bb6-42d0-a813-b995058b94c6'),('569abbe3-9dab-4496-8ecd-2de449b6c38b','2023-06-26 02:46:35','2023-06-26 02:46:35','Tulip','Tulips love cool soil so plant only when temperatures have dropped. Tulips require full sun for the best display, which means at least 6 hours of bright, direct sunlight per day. They also prefer fast-draining soil and, consequently, make excellent additions to rock gardens. After planting the bulbs in fall, top-dress the bed with a balanced, 10-10-10 or 10-15-10 slow-release fertilizer. Lightly cultivate the soil to disperse the fertilizer, or water it in well. Apply fertilizer to the top of the soil instead of the planting hole to avoid burning the bulbs.','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Tulip.jpg','f1246833-e566-466c-af56-af007e794e44'),('6a8ba1ef-aa3b-4052-9402-07fc1230da99','2023-06-26 02:18:07','2023-06-26 02:18:07','Garlic','Garlic grows best in well-drained, moisture-retentive soil with pH between 6.0 and 7.0.

Avoid drafts, cold spaces, rooms with sudden temperature drops and hot air vents. Orchids flourish in air that is 50 percent humidity or above. They can do well in moist places such as by a kitchen window. Orchids need to be fed regularly.

Choose a planting site that receives at six hours of sunlight per day. A fertilizer specifically made for flowers that contains equal or less amounts of nitrogen than phosphorus is suitable. One with a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium ratio of 5-10-10, 5-10-5, or 15-15-15, works well for flowers such as carnations.','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Carnations.jpeg','f1246833-e566-466c-af56-af007e794e44'),('a2fb989e-39ed-4438-8af0-6a1681e66823','2023-06-26 02:38:27','2023-06-26 02:38:27','Daisy','Daisies like rich, fast draining soil, ample water and plenty of sunshine. However, they are very adaptable and will tolerate poor soil conditions and partial shade. Work some well-aged animal manure or organic compost into the soil to help promote abundant blooms.

Lilacs also like slightly alkaline, moist, well-drained soil. Use a fertilizer that is high in phosphorus to encourage blooming, and avoid fertilizers that are high in nitrogen because too much nitrogen encourages foliage growth but not blooms.','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Lilac.jpeg','f1246833-e566-466c-af56-af007e794e44'),('c3670013-b114-4b14-9076-6079bc0d01a2','2023-06-26 02:35:24','2023-06-26 02:35:24','Spinach','Spinach likes full sun but will tolerate partial shade.

Water should only be applied directly to the root zone, not to the leaf surface. Soil pH affects the absorption of nutrients, and should be between 6.0-7.0.  Use a high-nitrogen fertilizer or top dress with alfalfa meal (5-1-2) for the first application to jump-start leaf development, along with epsom salts to encourage new cane development and lusher growth. Add a slow-release fertilizer when shoots are developing.','https://github.com/Dragneel0112/pro_port/blob/master/static/images/Rose.jpeg','f1246833-e566-466c-af56-af007e794e44'),('fdfe5ebb-33d1-49a6-8fa2-ce2ac5307227','2023-06-26 02:34:23','2023-06-26 02:34:23','Rocket','Rocket likes fertile soil that retains some moisture, sunny sites is fine but best in a cooler spot in light shade, to prolong cropping.
